### Reviewing Marcus Aurelius' Meditations

**W﻿ho:** Marcus Aurelius was a Roman noble who lived from 121-180 CE, he became heir to the Roman empire at the age of 17 and assumed the throne at the age of 40. 

**W﻿hat:** A collection of journal writings, not intended for publication but as a personal guide. Divided into 12 parts.

**W﻿here and when:** Exact dates and locations are difficult to verify for much of the work, but historians believe a large part of it was written during the last 10 years of his life while on military campaign through Central Europe.

**W﻿hy:** To create a guide for his own thoughts and actions. He sought to cultivate noble and productive behaviors while refraining from meaningless pursuits.

**H﻿ow:** Written in Koine Greek, likely using papyrus or parchment with a reed pen and ink.

This edition was translated in 1862 by George Long (1800-1879), an English writer and scholar.

A﻿ synopsis of the first 6 (of 12) parts are as follows:

**P﻿art 1:** Homages to the various teachers of his life, highlighting and reinforcing their most important lessons, and giving some observation of their character. Concludes with thanks to the gods for a fate that blessed him with so many lessons and experiences.

**P﻿art 2:** Regarding his relationship with society, to not be disheartened by the rude, obtuse, or anti-social behavior of others, but to strive for cooperation with others as the organs of a body work to benefit the whole. Nature provides use with sufficient providence to wholly busy ourselves with good and productive acts, without pursuing evil, distraction, or frivolity. 

D﻿eath is an operation of nature and should not be feared, for nothing evil resolves from nature. All acts should be carried out with the dignity, resolve, and bearing as if they were our last. To prevent the soul from bringing shame or doing violence to itself, our acts must not be thoughtless or without aim.

**P﻿art 3:** Even if a man lives long, it is unclear whether his faculty for intelligent reasoning will remain in good health. The present time must be charged with purpose, for not only do we hasten towards death but also the death of our conceptual abilities. 

A﻿ppreciating the progression of "ripening" in all things will allow one to enjoy many things the masses will not, but enjoyed only by those familiar with nature's works. This allows one to enjoy the maturity and comeliness in the elderly, and to look on the attractive loveliness of youths with chastity. 

T﻿houghts of others should be checked to attitudes of common utility, while refraining from gossip or envy. Simple and plain thoughts are best, those which would not cause us shame or to blush were they revealed. Endeavoring on this path is to mind only what belongs to oneself, and to be persuaded that one's own portion is good.

N﻿ever value the things which will compel you to uncouth, anti-social, or immoral behavior. Reverence our faculty providing opinion, it is the constitution of the rational being. Follow right reason seriously, vigorously, calmly, and without distraction, and you will live truthfully and happily. No man can prevent this. To be at the ready with your instruments of reason is to pass through life without compulsion, reconciled with one's lot (or destiny).

**P﻿art 4:** Free oneself from ostentatious display. The ruling power within us can take hold of all circumstances which befall us, as a fire takes any matter heaped upon it, and rises higher because of it. Common men seek a retreat in the country, but the greatest retreat is to the tranquility of one's own mind. To maintain the path of this retreat, do not follow what others value, but content thyself with destiny and your power of the present moment.

D﻿o what is necessary and meet the requirements of the social animal. This brings the tranquility both from doing well and doing few things. On every occasion a man should ask himself "is this necessary?" Keep this attitude towards acts and thoughts, for superfluous action is sure to follow superfluous thought. Try the life of a good man, satisfied with his portion of the whole and satisfied with his own just acts and benevolent disposition. Employ serious efforts in this one thing: thoughts just, acts social, words which never lie, and a disposition which gladly accepts all that happens as necessary, usual, and flowing from a principle source of the same kind.

**P﻿art 5:** Are we made for the pursuit of pleasure, and not for action or exertion? Rest and eat what is sufficient, and pursue your art. Worry not if others admire the sharpness of your wits, you may always enjoy the qualities within your power: sincerity, gravity, endurance of labor, aversion to pleasure, contentment with thy portion, benevolence, frankness, non-superfluity, and freedom from trifling magnanimity. Count not acts which are due favor, but let deeds fall like ripe fruit, ready again at next season.

E﻿verything which happens leads to the health of the whole (universe), refrain from dissatisfaction or cutting off the parts which appeal to you not, for they are expressions of the continuity of things. Be not discouraged if you do not succeed, but content thyself if the result is largely consistent with man's nature. Finding enjoyment in the simplicity of one's doings is wisdom. 

A﻿bout what am I employing my own soul? Is my ruling principle that of a child or a young man, a feeble old woman or a tyrant, a domestic animal or a beast? Your habitual thoughts will be the character of your mind, the soul is dyed by these thoughts. Things do not touch the soul, but it makes for itself whatever judgements it may think proper to make. Does another do me wrong? Let him look to it. He has his own will and disposition. I have what the universe wills me to have, and do what my nature wills me to do.

**P﻿art 6:** Perform dutifully to the social life of politics, but make frequent repose in philosophy. The multitudes value objects of a certain cohesion or natural organization, but he who values rational soul regards nothing else except this, and acts conforming to reason and the social life - cooperating with those who are the same kind as himself.

P﻿lants, beasts, and tyrants in turn may value transpiration, respiration, and the movements of their desire. What is to be valued? Not praise, but moving and conforming to the proper constitution, towards the ends of our employments or arts. All tools are wont to be adapted to their purpose: plants are cultivated for fruits, animals trained for labor, wood carved for fitting, and stone sculpted to image. So too we should strive towards ends of being adapted to purpose rather than left raw and untried, with only base motives.

I﻿f injured by another, do not treat them with suspicion or as an enemy, but simply get out of their way as it is in your power to do so. For animals and things generally, make use of them liberally, but for humans with reason, behave with a social spirit. If we judge only those things within our power to be good or bad, there will be no reason for faulting gods or taking a hostile attitude towards man. Should a man using force stand in your way, use the hinderance towards the exercise of some other virtue, rest content not trying the impossible but in achieving thy aim.
