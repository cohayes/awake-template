### What makes a great game?

Quality graphics, voice acting, or responsive controls? These things are important to immersion in modern video games, but they’re not necessary to the core experience of playing games. More important is to provide players with cycles of challenge and learning. Acquainting oneself with a rule set, and then developing strategy to overcome challenges is the essence of rewarding gameplay. This is true of many sports as well, from chess to billiards to soccer, understanding the rules comes first, then an evolving a strategy to align with one’s personal strengths. The cycles of growth and failure we experience while learning are what build up the accomplishment of finally meeting a goal or objective. I think that great games present progressively more difficult challenges to the player, while giving them time to learn and develop a strategy that suits their personality or play style. If the entire experience is luck and chance, a “game” provides no personal accomplishment to the success.

 

With these principles in mind, I decided tried my hand at **Bitburner**, a JavaScripting text-based CRPG. I tried to develop my own solutions to the challenges presented, and use online resources and guides minimally, as the main accomplishment is my own learning. When I did periodically search online forums for advice, I found many instances of code-dumps without in-line comments. I decided to create my own showcase as a response to these guides of unaccompanied code. By explaining my intention and solution developing process, I  will try to create a showcase of problem solving methods that is open to critique by anyone, resulting in the growth of myself and my audience.
