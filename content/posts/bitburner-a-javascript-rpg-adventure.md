### G﻿ames as cycles of challenge and learning

T﻿he JavaScripting game **Bitburner**, has managed to grab my attention and draw me into dialogue with expert programmers. The game's premise is to advance a character through a dystopian world inspired by the likes of popular science-fiction such as The Matrix, Blade Runner, Deus Ex and others. Fundamentally, Bitburner is about writing Javascript to programmatically achieve the success of your player character.

P﻿utting my nose to the grindstone (or documentation) could only take me so far, and I realized that approaching other programmers and learning from their experiences was the best avenue for my own growth. Joining the official Discord channel put me in direct collaboration with a group of people who had vast and varied backgrounds in computer science. It exposed me to an incredible amount of information about the historical and modern development of programming languages.

H﻿umbly, I realize that before I can add anything of value to this discourse, I must identify and clarify the existing body of knowledge. To that end, I will share some of the most popular tutorials highlighted by the community.

Quality graphics, voice acting, or responsive controls? These things are important to immersion in modern video games, but they’re not necessary to the core experience of playing games. More important is to provide players with cycles of challenge and learning. Acquainting oneself with a rule set, and then developing strategy to overcome challenges is the essence of rewarding gameplay. This is true of many sports as well, from chess to billiards to soccer, understanding the rules comes first, then an evolving a strategy to align with one’s personal strengths. The cycles of growth and failure we experience while learning are what build up the accomplishment of finally meeting a goal or objective. I think that great games present progressively more difficult challenges to the player, while giving them time to learn and develop a strategy that suits their personality or play style. If the entire experience is luck and chance, a “game” provides no personal accomplishment to the success.

With these principles in mind, I decided tried my hand at **Bitburner**, a JavaScripting text-based CRPG. I tried to develop my own solutions to the challenges presented, and use online resources and guides minimally, as the main accomplishment is my own learning. When I did periodically search online forums for advice, I found many instances of code-dumps without in-line comments. I decided to create my own showcase as a response to these guides of unaccompanied code. By explaining my intention and solution developing process, I  will try to create a showcase of problem solving methods that is open to critique by anyone, resulting in the growth of myself and my audience.
