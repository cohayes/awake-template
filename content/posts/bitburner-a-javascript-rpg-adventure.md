### Cycles of challenge and learning

T﻿he JavaScripting game *[Bitburner](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/)*, has managed to grab my attention and draw me into dialogue with expert programmers. The game's premise is to advance a character through a dystopian world inspired by the likes of popular science-fiction such as The Matrix, Blade Runner, Deus Ex and others. Fundamentally, *Bitburner* is about writing Javascript to programmatically achieve the success of your player character.

P﻿utting my nose to the grindstone (or documentation) could only take me so far, and I realized that approaching other programmers and learning from their experiences was the best avenue for my own growth. Joining the official Discord channel put me in direct collaboration with a group of people who have vast and varied backgrounds in computer science. It's exposed me to an incredible amount of information about the historical and modern development of programming languages.

H﻿umbly, I realize that before I can add anything of value to this discourse, I must identify and clarify the existing body of knowledge. To that end, I will share some of the most popular tutorials highlighted by the community.

* [D﻿arkTechnomancer's Beginner's Guide to Batching](https://darktechnomancer.github.io/)
* [X﻿SINX's Algorithms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1za34sQ6zpQ9lOAHoXuqrAwJFH5qJtslRXrj8FnB91d4/)
* [T﻿he Official GitHub Repository (Game Source Code)](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src)
* [P﻿hilipArmstead's Collection of GUI and Quality of Life Code](https://github.com/PhilipArmstead/BitBurner-Scripts/)

I﻿'ve greatly enjoyed my time putting together code libraries and some rudimentary databases, and plan to share my own code once the quality is fit for publication. The content of *Bitburner* includes cyphering and card counting as side activities, I look forward to attempting these programming challenges and will report my success or failure respectively!
